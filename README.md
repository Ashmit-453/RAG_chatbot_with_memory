## RAG-CHATBOT
- The RAG Chatbot with Memory enhances traditional RAG architectures by integrating memory features, allowing it to recall previous conversations and deliver contextually relevant responses. It uses a combination of retrieval-based and generation-based techniques to provide accurate and human-like answers.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative models to provide accurate and relevant responses.
- **Memory Capability**: Retains context from previous conversations, enabling better and more coherent responses over long conversations.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Retrieves relevant documents or snippets from a knowledge base to enhance the accuracy and depth of responses.
- **Customizable Memory**: Configure how much and what kind of information the chatbot remembers.

## Architecture
- **Retrieval Module**: Fetches relevant information from a predefined knowledge base (e.g., documents, FAQs, databases).
- **Generation Module**: Uses a language model (e.g., GPT, BERT) to generate responses based on the retrieved information and current user query.
- **Memory Module**: Stores and recalls past conversation details to provide contextually relevant responses.
